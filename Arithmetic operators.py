#Take two numbers as input from the user and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient

#sum
num1 = int (input("Enter your first number :"))
num2 = int (input("Enter your second number :"))
total = num1 + num2
print(total)

# difference
a = int (input("Enter first number :"))
b = int (input("Enter second number"))
c = a - b
print ("difference of two", c)

# product
d = int(input("Enter your first number :"))
e = int (input("Enter your second number"))
f = d * e
print ("product of two number :", f)

#quotient
g = int (input("Enter your first number:"))
h = int (input("Enter your second number"))
i = g / h 
print ("quotient of two num :", i)
